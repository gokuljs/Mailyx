## S3 Storage for Search Indices

Mailyx uses AWS S3 to store Orama search indices. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of search indices by account ID.

### AWS S3 Configuration

To configure AWS S3 storage for search indices, add the following variables to your `.env` file:

```env
# AWS S3 Configuration for Orama indices
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key_here
S3_BUCKET_NAME=mailyx-orama-indices
```

Make sure to create the S3 bucket with appropriate permissions before using this feature.
